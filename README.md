# Emerging-Technology-Project
###### Written by Sammar Tahir

In this repository you will a Nerual Network that is trained to predict what number is present on a image passed in from a front end web application. The technologies I've used for this project are python tensorflow with keras and flask.

### Running
To run the web application, type the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SammarTahir/Emerging-Technology-Project.git

cd Emerging-Technology-Project/web-app

python wa.py

# In browser open 127.0.0.1/5000:

```

More information about how the nerual works can be found on my jupyter notebook _ProjectWork.ipynb_
